A turnkey solution for organizations to give people the opportunity to participate in writing a Torah Scroll. Participants are also given an NFT representing their letter.

== Description ==

Is your family or organization writing a new Torah Scroll? Would you like to give people the opportunity to participate by purchasing 1 or more letters?
It is a big mitzvah for every Jew to own a letter in a Torah Scroll.
If you want to give people that opportunity, then we want to help you.

As long as you are creating a kosher Torah. You can use this FREE plugin to offer this on your website.
The plugin uses Stripe and PayPal to allow your users/partners to pay for those letters. You should have your own Stripe & PayPal accounts to process those funds. The API keys, Client IDs, and SECRET keys should be provided as environment variables. If you need help setting that up. Pleae have the most technical person on your staff contact us.

Participants are also given an NFT representing their letter.
This is kinds of a side point. But it could be a major publicity gimmick for you. potentially bringing in much more intrest and many more partners.
NFTs are Non-Fungible Tokens. They are a way to use the blockchain (think bitcoin) to digitally sign an item as being 100% unique. NFTs ca be resold on marketplaces like opensea.io and are all the rage in certain circles. The NFTs created by this plugin certify that your user owns a letter in your Torah Scroll. The NFT can be transferred to their digital wallet for everlasting proof and display.
The NFTs are all created behind the scenes (you will need to provide a wallet with cryptocurrency to pay the 'gas') and even novice users can download them seamlessly.

    If no stable tag is provided, it is assumed that trunk is stable, but you should specify "trunk" if that's where
you put the stable version, in order to eliminate any doubt.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do users need a crypto wallet to get an NFT? =

No. We create a wallet for each user on the spot. They can just download the file. Then later when they get a crypto wallet one day they can import it.

= Which blockchain do you use? =

Currently we are using Ethereum's `Rinkeby`. We know that it is a testnet. Nevertheless due to the *Novelty Item* nature of our tokens we feel that it is sufficient. However we are working on move to Matic/Polygon. We just can't be on a blockchain where gas fees would be more than the product.

= How does this work for people who don't know what an NFT is? =

Not a problem at all. They will be able to make a purchase/donation without ever interacting with the NFT. We then make it super simple to download it they want it. They can even totoaly ignore it. Then at some later point in time, they can come back and download it. Your plugin will save a copy of their wallet.
